Create a detailed plan to create a beautiful, fun and engaging game with React + Vite + TypeScript which supports statically hosted file deployments so it can only utilize Browser Storage, e.g. IndexedDB, localStorage. The plan should be detailed enough for a LLM to be able to build the entire implementation from it. Here is the description of the game:

you have to hide from an ai bot for 3 minutes in a big room with corridors and portals all around. after you win a game (you win by surviving until the time runs out) you get 50 coins that can be spent on powerups, skins and pets.
